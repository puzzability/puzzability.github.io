        <div class="whatIsTextPar">
            <p>Puzzability is a puzzle-writing company. But the puzzles and games created by Puzzability are not your typical word searches and dot-to-dots. Whether for adults or kids, whether for print or electronic media, whether general-interest or made-to-order, our puzzles are involving, rewarding, and, above all, fresh. Puzzability can create puzzles for websites, social media, ads, packaging and promotions, game and reality shows, corporate events, contests, CD-ROMs, magazines &mdash; yes, even diner placemats.</p>

                <div class="whoIsText">
                    <p>Mike Shenk is, to puzzle lovers, probably the greatest thing since the electric pencil sharpener. One of the most versatile puzzle constructors and editors in the country, he provided a stunning assortment of pencil puzzles for <i>Games</i> magazine and its offshoots for 16 years, even while constructing daily crosswords for a major newspaper syndicate. Today he is the puzzle editor for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Mike also writes Java programs for Puzzability's interactive solving, as well as computer programs that set crosswords and many other types of puzzles. Even we are not sure how he does all this. </p>

                <h2 align="center">Amy Goldstein</h2>
                <div class="whoIsText">
                    <p>Amy Goldstein was Associate Editor, and later Managing Editor, of <i>Games</i> magazine and its sister publications for four years. Before that, she spent eight years in book publishing (specifically, at Peterson's Guides, where she became Managing Editor). She is a trivia buff, wordsmith, and variety puzzle constructor who has developed and produced a broad range of visual and verbal puzzles with special emphasis on pop culture and wordplay. Amy was also a contestant on a game show we will refer to as <i>Xxxxxxxx!</i> because she signed an agreement saying she wouldn't exploit this fact for self-promotion.</p>

                <div class="whoIsText">
                    <p>Robert Leighton has been creating and illustrating his own brand of one-of-a-kind visual puzzles since 1982, first in <i>Games</i> magazine, later in <i>Disney Adventures</i>, <i>Nickelodeon</i> magazine, and a host of national advertising campaigns. An occasional children's book illustrator, television writer, and <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist, Robert, too, was once on a game show: <i>To Tell the Truth</i>, which means, if you recall, that two other jokers were forced to say "My name is Robert Leighton."</p>

The book takes the form of a distressed survival guide heavily used and annotated by the survivor of a Manhattan pandemic. In the story's world, the guide's author had a terrible secret: He knew this disaster was coming. Puzzability was brought in to hide his coded warnings throughout the survival guide, and to hide the survivor's added coded messages as well. These puzzles appear in the book's text and in removable artifacts like a missing persons poster, a transit pass, and a foldout map of New York, all of which help bring the survivor's harrowing experiences to life in a way that breaks new ground in publishing.</p><br/><br/><br/>
