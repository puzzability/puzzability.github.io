            <h2 class="newsTitles">Solve to Survive!</h2>
            <p><i>New York Collapse</i> is a chilling meta-novel that serves as a companion piece to the new game Tom Clancy's <i>The Division</i> &mdash; and it stands on its own as well. The book takes the form of a distressed survival guide heavily used and annotated by the survivor of a Manhattan pandemic. In the story's world, the guide's author had a terrible secret: He knew this disaster was coming. Puzzability was brought in to hide his coded warnings throughout the survival guide, and to hide the survivor's added coded messages as well. These puzzles appear in the book's text and in removable artifacts like a missing persons poster, a transit pass, and a foldout map of New York, all of which help bring the survivor's harrowing experiences to life in a way that breaks new ground in publishing.</p> <br>
