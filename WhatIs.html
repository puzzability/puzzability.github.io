        <p>Puzzability is a puzzle-writing company. But the puzzles and games created by Puzzability are not your typical word searches and dot-to-dots. Whether for adults or kids, whether for print or electronic media, whether general-interest or made-to-order, our puzzles are involving, rewarding, and, above all, fresh. Puzzability can create puzzles for websites, social media, ads, packaging and promotions, game and reality shows, corporate events, contests, CD-ROMs, magazines â€” yes, even diner placemats.</p> <br>

            <h2>Solvability</h2>
            <p>A puzzle left unsolved is basically a failure. Puzzles are made to be solved.</p>

            <img src="./images/draw.png" alt="solvability">
            <h2>Play Value</h2>
            <p>Puzzles are not tests. They're entertainment.</p>

            <img src="./images/smile.png" alt="solvability">
            <h2>Humor</h2>
            <p>A good puzzle is a bit like a joke. The unsolved components are a set-up, and the solution is the punch line.</p>
